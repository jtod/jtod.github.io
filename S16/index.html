<p>Sigma16 is a computer architecture designed for research and teaching in computer systems. This application provides a complete environment for experimenting with the architecture.</p>
<p>This is the Sigma16 home page (<a href="https://jtod.github.io/S16/">https://jtod.github.io/S16/</a>). It contains general information, pointers to various resources, and an executable version. To view and download the source code, see the Sigma16 source repository (<a href="https://github.com/jtod/Sigma16">https://github.com/jtod/Sigma16</a>).</p>
<p>Quick start:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jtod.github.io/S16/dev/app/Sigma16.html"><strong>Launch Sigma16 to run in your browser</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="https://jtod.github.io/S16/dev/app/doc/html/userguide.html">Read the User Guide</a> This includes documentation of the architecture, programming, and installation.</li>
</ul>
<p>This architecture is simpler than most commercial products making it a good vehicle for teaching and experimentation.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A 16-bit architecture with a simple yet powerful instruction set.</p></li>
<li><p>A small subset of the architecture is suitable for introductory teaching, but more advanced features support systems programming.</p></li>
<li><p>Software tools include an assembler, linker, emulator, and IDE.</p></li>
<li><p>Examples are provided that illustrate a variety of programming techniques, data structures, compilation patterns, concurrency and mutual exclusion, and more.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a digital circuit that implements Sigma16, which includes several microarchitecture implementations as well as logic designs specified at the level of logic gates and flip flops. These circuits are specified using Hydra, a functional computer hardware description language. Sigma16 programs can be executed using the emulator, and they can also be executed by simulating the digital circuit using the Hydra tools.</p></li>
<li><p>The User Guide is displayed in the running application, and you can also read it here without launching the program: <a href="app/doc/html/userguide-index.html">User Guide</a> The user manual is available as html in datafiles/doc/html/index.html.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note (autumn 2019): The architecture, software, and documentation are currently being revised; this is a development version and it is not ready for general use. There are several earlier releases, as well as extensive documentation, but those are available only on a protected Moodle server. The new version is expected to be available on github around the beginning of February 2020. The notes below, as well as the user guide, are incomplete and refer to previous versions, so the current documentation is inconsistent with the current software.</em></p>
<h2 id="running-the-app">Running the app</h2>
<p>The software is implemented in JavaScript and can be executed directly in a web browser simply by clicking the “Quick start” link at the top of this page.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can download the source files from the <a href="https://github.com/jtod/Sigma16">source repository.</a></p>
<p>ownload the files and visit index.html in a browser. After the download, you won’t need to be connected to the Internet, but a few features won’t work. When you open one of the example programs, you need to copy it and paste it into the Editor tab (the button “Copy example to editor” won’t work).</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Build an executable</em> compiled for your platform. The app will run faster, it has better ability to save files, and it doesn’t need access to the Internet.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="releases">Releases</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Version 3.1 is planned for release in February 2020.</p></li>
<li><p>Releases before the Version 3 series are no longer supported.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="development-versions">Development versions</h3>
<p>The following versions are intended for development and testing of the software, and are not recommended for general use. There will be incomplete and experimental features, as well as inconsistencies between the code and the documentation.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="./dev/app/Sigma16.html">Run the latest development version</a> This is a pre-release for the next version. It is intended for development only, may be unstable, and may not be suitable for general users.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="./releases/3.0.32/index.html">3.0.32</a> pre-release testing version</p></li>
<li><p><a href="./releases/3.0.31/index.html">3.0.31</a> pre-release testing version</p></li>
<li><p><a href="./releases/3.0.30/index.html">3.0.30</a> pre-release testing version</p></li>
<li><p><a href="./releases/3.0.29/index.html">3.0.29</a> pre-release testing version</p></li>
<li><p><a href="./releases/3.0.28/index.html">3.0.28</a> pre-release testing version</p></li>
<li><p><a href="./releases/Sigma16-3.0.27/index.html">version 3.0.27</a> Test version</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="about-the-software">About the software</h2>
<p>This is free software. The author is <a href="https://jtod.github.io/index.html">John O’Donnell</a>. Email: john.t.odonnnell9@gmail.com</p>
<p>The Sigma16 app is implemented in JavaScript, html 5, and css. A fast emulator written in C will be available soon. The digital circuit is implemented in Hydra, which requires Haskell.</p>
