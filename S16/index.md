Sigma16 is a computer architecture for at teaching and research.

This is free software.  The author is [John
O'Donnell](https://jtod.github.io/index.html).

The sofware is implemented in javascript, html, and css.  The source
files are on the project page (jtod.github.io/Sigma16) where you can
view or download the source.  To run the code, go to
jtod.github.io/S16.

## Running the software

You can run Sigma16 in several ways:

  * [Run the latest release in your
    browser](./releases/3.0.29/index.html)

  * [Download the source files](jtod.github.io/Sigma16) and visit
    index.html in a browser. After the download, you won't need to be
    connected to the Internet, but a few features won't work.  When
    you open one of the example programs, you need to copy it and
    paste it into the Editor tab (the button "Copy example to editor"
    won't work).

  * *Download or build the executable* compiled for your platform.
    The app will run faster, it has better ability to save files, and
    it doesn't need access to the Internet.
