mux1
(Aside: Sometimes it's helpful to describe some signals as *control
signals* because they affect what the circuit does, and to describe
others as *data signals* because they carry variable values.  Since
the behavior of the mux1 is controlled by *c*, this is a control
input.  Since *x* and *y* are just arbitrary values, these are called
data signals.  But it's important to realise that this terminology --
control and data signal -- is just a way of talking about the signals.
As far as the actual components and wires are concerned, there is no
difference between data and control.)

This if-then-else expression is a programming construct, and it
doesn't directly correspond to digital hardware.

# rtm n k ld add d sa sb x = (a,b,y,c,s)
#   where
#     (a,b) = regfile n k ld d sa sb y
#     y = mux1w add x s
#     (c,s) = rippleAdd zero (bitslice2 a b)
