These files are for testing the implementation of Sigma16.  They also
provide examples of all the assembly language statements and the
instruction set.

- [[./AsmCodeGen.asm.txt][AsmCodeGen]] Test an example of each
  assembly language statement, including instructions and directives.

- [[./AsmErrMessages.asm.txt][AsmErrMessages]] Examples of errors that
  are detectable by the assembler.

- [[./Arithmetic.asm.txt][TestArithmetic]] Test arithmetic operations.

- [[./StoreLoop.asm.txt][StoreLoop]] While loop containing a store
  instruction.

- [[./Logic.asm.txt][Logic]] Test the operations on bits, fields, and
  words.

- [[./Memory.asm.txt][Memory]] Loads, stores, stack operations, saving
  and restoring registers.

- [[./CmpJump.asm.txt][CmpJump]] Test the comparisons, jumps, and
  conditional jumps.

- [[./Performance.asm.txt][Performance]] A long nested loop that
  executes a large number of instructions, allowing measurements of
  the perfornace of an emulator or other implementation.

- [[./PrimarySecondary.asm.txt][PrimarySecondary]]

- [[./RFwrite.asm.txt][RFwrite]]
