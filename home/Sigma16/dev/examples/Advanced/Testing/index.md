# Testing

These files are for testing the implementation of Sigma16.  They also
provide examples of all the assembly language statements and the
instruction set.

* [AsmCodeGen](AsmCodeGen.asm.txt) Examples of each assembly language
  statement, including instructions and directives.

* [AsmErrMessages](AsmErrMessages.asm.txt) Examples of errors that are
  detectable by the assembler.

* [Arithmetic](Arithmetic.asm.txt) Test arithmetic operations.

* [Logic](Logic.asm.txt) Test the operations on bits, fields, and
  words.

* [Memory](Memory.asm.txt)  Loads, stores, stack operations, saving
  and restoring registers.

* [CmpJump](CmpJump.asm.txt) Test the comparisons, jumps, and
  conditional jumps.

* [Performance](Performance.asm.txt) A long nested loop that executes
  a large number of instructions, allowing measurements of the
  perfornace of an emulator or other implementation.

* Modules: [Mod1](Mod1.asm.txt) Mod1 imports Mod2 and Mod3,
  [Mod2](Mod2.asm.txt) Mod1 imports Mod2 and Mod3, and
  [Mod3](Mod3.asm.txt) Mod1 imports Mod2 and Mod3

* [PrimarySecondary](PrimarySecondary.asm.txt)

* [RFwrite](RFwrite.asm.txt)
