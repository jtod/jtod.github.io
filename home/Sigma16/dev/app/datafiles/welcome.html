<p>Version 3.1.4, April 2020</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Sigma16 is a computer architecture designed for research and teaching in computer systems. This application provides a complete environment for experimenting with the architecture, including an editor, assembler, linker, emulator, and an integrated development environment. There is a digital circuit that implements the architecture, which is specified using the Hydra functional hardware description language. Hydra can simulate the circuit, and machine language programs can run on both the emulator and the circuit.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>The User Guide begins with a set of tutorials that introduce the system. The best place to start is with the <em>Hello, World!</em> tutorial. After working through the tutorials, see the rest of the User Guide for detailed documentation.</p>
<p>The User Guide appears in the right side of the window. You can increase or decrease its size by clicking the arrow buttons at the right side of the top button box, and you can also <a
href="../../docs/html/userguide/userguide.html" target="_blank">open the user guide in a new window</a>.</p>
<h2 id="updates-and-resources">Updates and resources</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://jtod.github.io/home/Sigma16/"
target="_blank">Sigma16 Home Page</a> contains a link to run the latest version as well as up-to-date information on the system. It’s best to bookmark the home page, not this specific release. If you always launch the app by clicking the link in the home page, you’ll always be running the most recent release.</p>
