    <p>Version VERSION</p>

    <p> Sigma16 is a computer architecture designed for research and
        teaching in computer systems.
    </p>
    <p> This application provides a complete environment for
        experimenting with the architecture, including an editor,
        assembler, linker, emulator, and an integrated development
        environment.  There is a digital circuit that implements the
        architecture, which is specified using the Hydra functional
        hardware description language.  Hydra can simulate the
        circuit, and machine language programs can run on both the
        emulator and the circuit.
    </p>
    <p> <strong>Getting started.</strong> The tutorials in the User
      Guide introduce the system.  Detailed documentation appears in
      the reference sections in the guide.
    </p>

      can increase or decrease its size by clicking the arrow buttons
      at the right side of the top button box, and you can also open
