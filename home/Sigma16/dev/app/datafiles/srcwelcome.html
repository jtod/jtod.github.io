    <p>Version VERSION</p>
    <p> <strong>Overview.</strong> Sigma16 is a computer architecture
        designed for research and teaching in computer systems.  This
        application provides a complete environment for experimenting
        with the architecture, including an editor, assembler, linker,
        emulator, and an integrated development environment.  There is
        a digital circuit that implements the architecture, which is
        specified using the Hydra functional hardware description
        language.  Hydra can simulate the circuit, and machine
        language programs can run on both the emulator and the
        circuit.
