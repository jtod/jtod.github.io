# Sigma16 sharp

Version VERSION

## Overview

Sigma16 is a computer architecture designed for research and teaching
in computer systems.  This application provides a complete environment
for experimenting with the architecture, including an editor,
assembler, linker, emulator, and an integrated development
environment.  There is a digital circuit that implements the
architecture, which is specified using the Hydra functional hardware
description language.  Hydra can simulate the circuit, and machine
language programs can run on both the emulator and the circuit.
