<h1 id="sigma16-source-directory">Sigma16 source directory</h1>
<p>This is the README file for the Sigma16 source directory.</p>
<p>Sigma16 is a computer architecture designed for research and teaching in computer systems. This application provides a complete environment for experimenting with the architecture.</p>
<h2 id="quick-start-running-sigma16-in-a-web-page">Quick start: Running Sigma16 in a web page</h2>
<p>You don’t need to install anything. Just visit the <a href="https://jtod.github.io/home/Sigma16/">Sigma16 Home Page</a> and click the prominent link to “Run Sigma16 in your browser”.</p>
<h2 id="internet-links">Internet links</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://jtod.github.io/home/Sigma16/">Sigma16 Home Page (https://jtod.github.io/home/Sigma16/)</a> contains a link to “Run Sigma16 in your browser”, as well as links to documentation, past releases, and the source repository <a href="https://github.com/jtod/Sigma16/">source repository (https://github.com/jtod/Sigma16/)</a>. It’s best to bookmark the home page, which always points to the latest version.</p>
<h2 id="download-and-run-locally">Download and run locally</h2>
<p>To run the IDE (the graphical user interface) there is no need to download or install the software: you can just <em>Click to run Sigma16 in your browser</em> in the <a href="https://jtod.github.io/home/Sigma16/">Sigma16 Home Page</a>.</p>
<p>The Home Page also provides a link to download the app. If you copy the Sigma16 source directory onto your computer, the following links will run it locally without any additional software installation and without requiring further access to the Internet. However, these links will not work if you’re reading this page on the source repository on GitHub via the Internet.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="./app/Sigma16.html">Launch from files in this directory</a> If you have copied this directory onto a local machine, this link will run it. The advantage is that you won’t need access to the Internet. However, browsers have restricted access to your file system, to ensure security. One consequence of this is that the <em>Select example</em> button in the <em>Examples</em> page won’t do anything. But you can select the text of the example with your mouse, right-click and Copy, then Paste it into the Editor page. It’s also possible to install Sigma16 as an app on your computer; that gets rid of the restrictions on file access. See the Installation section in the User Guide.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="./">Up to the top directory</a> Show the listing of files in the directory containing this version.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="installing-the-command-line-tools">Installing the command line tools</h2>
<p>In addition to the basic web page version of Sigma16, there is a collection of separate programs that can be run in a shwll from the command line. <em>(These are under development and will be released in late 2020; please come back later.)</em> These programs include a standalone version of the IDE, circuit simulator, and more. These tools provide additional functionality, faster execution, and the ability to work without access to the Internet.</p>
<h2 id="about-the-software">About the software</h2>
<p>The Sigma16 app (the integrated development environment – i.e. the GUI) is implemented in JavaScript, html 5, and css. The digital circuit is implemented in Hydra, which requires Haskell. Additional software tools, including a high speed emulator, are in progress and expected to be available in late 2020.</p>
