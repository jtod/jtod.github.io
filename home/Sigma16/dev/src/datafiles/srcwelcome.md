Version VERSION

## Overview

Sigma16 is a computer architecture designed for research and teaching
in computer systems.  This application provides a complete environment
for experimenting with the architecture, including an editor,
assembler, linker, emulator, and an integrated development
environment.  There is a digital circuit that implements the
architecture, which is specified using the Hydra functional hardware
description language.  Hydra can simulate the circuit, and machine
language programs can run on both the emulator and the circuit.

## Getting started

The User Guide begins with a set of tutorials that introduce the
system.  The best place to start is with the *Hello, World!* tutorial.
After working through the tutorials, see the rest of the User Guide
for detailed documentation.

The User Guide appears in the right side of the window.  You can
increase or decrease its size by clicking the arrow buttons at the
right side of the top button box, and you can also <a
href="../../docs/html/userguide/userguide.html" target="_blank">open
the user guide in a new window</a>.

## Updates and further information

The <a href="https://jtod.github.io/home/Sigma16/"
target="_blank">Sigma16 Home Page</a> contains a link to run the
latest version as well as up-to-date information on the system.  It's
best to bookmark the home page, not this specific release.  If you
always launch the app by clicking the link in the home page, you'll
always be running the most recent release.
