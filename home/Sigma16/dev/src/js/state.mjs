// state.mjs defines global state for the system, IDE, modules, and
// emulator
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// The main components of the program avoid using global variables;
// instead the necessary state is organized into records and passed as
// needed to the functions.  This module defines those records.  The
// gui operations, defined in Sigma16.html, call the emulator's
// interface functios with the state, for example boot(emulatorState).
